# Excel and Power Query Class Notes

## Course Introduction

This class focuses on advanced Excel techniques, particularly Excel dashboards and Power Query for data management. The instructor emphasizes that practice is essential for mastering these concepts.

### Key Learning Objectives

- Master Excel dashboard creation
- Understand Power Query fundamentals
- Learn advanced data cleaning techniques
- Apply real-world business case scenarios

## Power Query: Data Transformation and Cleaning

### Introduction to Power Query

Power Query is a powerful data transformation tool within Excel that provides advanced data cleaning and manipulation capabilities.

### Key Advantages of Power Query

1. **Dynamic Updates**: Changes in source data automatically reflect in output
2. **Scalability**: Handles large datasets efficiently
3. **Repeatability**: Transformations can be applied consistently
4. **Non-destructive**: Original data remains unchanged

### Data Import Process

#### Getting Data

1. Navigate to **Data** → **Get Data** → **From File** → **Excel Workbook**
2. Select source file from desired location
3. Choose **Transform** to enter Power Query Editor

**Important**: Never work directly with files on removable drives or temporary locations, as Power Query maintains references to original file paths.

### Essential Data Cleaning Techniques

#### 1. Header Management

- Use **Use First Row as Headers** to promote column names
- Ensure proper column identification before proceeding with transformations

#### 2. Handling Missing and Invalid Data

**Trimming Whitespace**

- Right-click on column → **Transform** → **Trim**
- Removes leading, trailing, and excess spaces between words

**Replace Values**

- Right-click → **Replace Values**
- Find: `Null` or `?` or invalid entries
- Replace with: `Not Defined` or appropriate values

#### 3. Column Splitting Techniques

Power Query offers multiple splitting options:

**By Delimiter**

- Split on spaces, commas, or custom characters
- Options: Leftmost delimiter, rightmost delimiter, or each occurrence

**By Position**

- Split at specific character positions
- Useful for fixed-width data formats

**By Digit/Non-Digit Boundaries**

- Automatically separates numeric and text portions
- Ideal for mixed data types in single columns

**Advanced Splitting Options**

- Split by uppercase/lowercase transitions
- Split by custom patterns
- Multiple delimiter handling

#### 4. Data Type Management

- Ensure proper data types for calculations
- Convert text to numbers where appropriate
- Handle date formatting consistently

### Working with Conditional Columns

#### Creating Salary Buckets Example

1. **Add Column** → **Conditional Column**
2. Set column name (e.g., "Salary Bucket")
3. Define conditions:
    - If salary ≤ 50,000 → "Under 50K"
    - Else If salary ≤ 100,000 → "50K to 100K"
    - Else → "Above 100K"

#### Multiple Condition Logic

- Use nested conditions for complex scenarios
- Else clause serves as the default option
- Conditions are evaluated in order

### Power Query vs Traditional Excel

| Aspect              | Traditional Excel             | Power Query                        |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Data Dependency** | Formula and column dependent  | Independent transformation steps   |
| **Updates**         | Manual recalculation required | Automatic refresh capability       |
| **Scalability**     | Limited by worksheet size     | Handles large datasets efficiently |
| **Repeatability**   | Manual process each time      | Automated transformation steps     |
| **Data Integrity**  | Risk of formula errors        | Maintains data lineage             |

## Best Practices and Tips

### Data Management

1. **Source Data Integrity**: Keep original data in a stable, accessible location
2. **Documentation**: Maintain clear naming conventions for queries and steps
3. **Testing**: Validate transformations with sample data before full implementation
4. **Version Control**: Save different versions of complex queries

### Performance Considerations

1. **Filtering Early**: Apply filters as early as possible in the transformation process
2. **Column Selection**: Remove unnecessary columns to improve performance
3. **Data Types**: Ensure appropriate data types for optimal processing

### Collaboration and Sharing

- When sharing Power Query outputs, consider copying and pasting values
- Shared network locations work best for team environments
- Document data source requirements for other users

## Common Use Cases and Applications

### Business Scenario Examples

1. **Sales Data Analysis**: Combining multiple regional sales files
2. **Inventory Management**: Tracking minimum prices across suppliers
3. **Employee Data**: Cleaning and standardizing HR information
4. **Financial Reporting**: Consolidating data from multiple departments

### Real-World Applications

- Monthly report automation
- Data quality improvement
- Legacy system data migration
- Dashboard data preparation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Data Source Problems

- **File Path Changes**: Update data source settings when files move
- **Permission Issues**: Ensure proper file access rights
- **Network Connectivity**: Verify network paths for shared files

### Transformation Errors

- **Data Type Mismatches**: Check and correct column data types
- **Missing Values**: Handle nulls and empty cells appropriately
- **Formula Errors**: Validate conditional logic and expressions

### Performance Issues

- **Large Datasets**: Consider filtering and column selection optimization
- **Complex Transformations**: Break down into simpler steps
- **Memory Usage**: Monitor system resources during processing

## Future Learning Directions

### Advanced Topics

- Power Pivot integration
- DAX formula usage
- Complex data modeling
- Automated reporting systems

### Skill Development

- Practice with real-world datasets
- Explore industry-specific use cases
- Learn complementary tools and techniques
- Stay updated with Excel feature updates

## Conclusion

Power Query represents a significant advancement in Excel's data handling capabilities. By mastering these techniques, analysts can:

- Automate repetitive data cleaning tasks
- Handle larger and more complex datasets
- Maintain data quality and consistency
- Create more reliable and maintainable reporting solutions

The key to success is consistent practice with real-world scenarios and gradually building complexity in transformations and analyses.
