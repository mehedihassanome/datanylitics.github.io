# Excel 40th Anniversary: Game-Changing Skills and Hidden Tips

Excel turned 40, and to celebrate, this guide shares four game-changing skills and hidden tips from each decade that remain powerful today. Mastering these will make everything else in Excel easier. Below, we dive into PivotTables, Excel Tables, Power Query, and Dynamic Arrays, with practical tips to enhance your workflow.

## 1990s: PivotTables

PivotTables, introduced in 1993, are a cornerstone of Excel's data analysis capabilities, still doing the heavy lifting today. Here's how to leverage them effectively with a lesser-known tip.

### Creating a PivotTable

To demonstrate, consider a dataset with sales data and various attributes for aggregation. Follow these steps to create a PivotTable:

1. Navigate to the **Insert** tab and select **PivotTable**.
2. Choose a destination sheet (e.g., a sheet named "1990s" for this example) and place the PivotTable in cell B8.
3. Drag the PivotTable field list closer for convenience.
4. To analyze sales by product, drag the **Product** field into the **Rows** area and the **Sales** field into the **Values** area.
5. To display the percentage of sales by product, drag the **Sales** field into the **Values** area again, right-click, select **Show Values As**, and choose **Percentage of Grand Total**.
6. Rename the new column heading to "Percent of Total".

This setup provides a summarized view of sales by product, including their percentage of the total.

### Filtering with Slicers vs. Filters

To filter data by fields like **Country**, **Segment**, **Discount Band**, and **Manager**, you can use slicers or traditional filters:

- **Slicers**: On the PivotTable, insert slicers for the desired fields. However, slicers can take up significant space. You may choose to delete them if they clutter your workspace.
- **Filters**: Add the fields (**Manager**, **Segment**, **Country**, **Discount Band**) to the **Filters** area. By default, filters stack vertically, which can consume vertical space, especially for wide PivotTables.

### Hidden Tip: Optimize Filter Layout

To make filters more space-efficient:

1. Right-click the PivotTable and select **PivotTable Options**.
2. Go to the **Layout and Format** tab.
3. In the **Display Fields in Report Filter Area** section, change the default "Down, Then Over" to "Over, Then Down", or adjust the **Number of Fields per Column** to two.
4. Click **OK**.

This rearranges filters across multiple columns, reducing vertical space usage, which is ideal for wide PivotTables.

## 2000s: Excel Tables

Introduced in 2007, Excel Tables upgraded the older Lists feature, offering powerful data management tools. Here's how to use them effectively.

### Creating a Table

To create a table:

1. Use the keyboard shortcut **Ctrl+T** (or the older **Ctrl+L** shortcut).
2. Alternatively, go to the **Home** tab, select **Format as Table**, and choose a style (e.g., a green style to match a theme).
3. Ensure the "My table has headers" option is checked, then click **OK**.

Tables come with built-in features like filter buttons and automatic totals.

### Adding Totals

To add a total row:

1. Scroll to the bottom of the table.
2. Check the **Total Row** box in the table options.
3. Choose an aggregation type (e.g., **SUM**, **AVERAGE**, **COUNT**). The default is **SUM**.

However, totals at the bottom can be inconvenient. Instead:

1. Turn off the total row.
2. At the top of the table, insert an **AGGREGATE** function to sum data while ignoring filtered rows:
    - Use `=AGGREGATE(9, 1, Table1[Sales])`, where:
        - `9` represents **SUM**.
        - `1` ignores hidden rows and nested **SUBTOTAL**/**AGGREGATE** functions.
        - `Table1[Sales]` references the **Sales** column using structured references, which are easier to read than cell references.
3. Add a label for the total.

This formula automatically adjusts when filters are applied (e.g., filtering for 2025 data).

### Filtering with Slicers

To filter a table using slicers:

1. With the table selected, go to the **Table Design** tab and select **Insert Slicer**.
2. Choose a field (e.g., **Category**) and click **OK**.
3. Customize the slicer (e.g., set to four columns, color-code to match the theme, and resize to align with the table).
4. Click slicer options to filter data (e.g., select **Components**, **Clothing**, **Bikes**, **Accessories**). You can select multiple options by dragging.

The **AGGREGATE** formula updates dynamically as filters are applied.

### Hidden Tip: Automatic Table Expansion

Tables automatically expand to include new data:

1. Filter the table (e.g., for **Bikes**) to see the bottom row.
2. Add new data in the row immediately below the table (e.g., for 2026, **Bikes**, **Cargo Bikes**, sales of 5,000).
3. The table range expands to include the new row, and the **AGGREGATE** formula updates to reflect the new data.

This ensures data integrity, automatic updates, and instant filtering without manual adjustments.

## 2010s: Power Query

Power Query, first released as an add-in in 2010, automates data gathering and cleaning, allowing reports to be updated with one click. Here's how to use it for monthly data files.

### Importing Data from a Folder

For data received in monthly CSV, text, or Excel files (e.g., revenue by region):

1. Go to the **Data** tab, select **Get Data**, then **From File**, and choose **From Folder**.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the files and click **Open**.
3. A list of files and metadata appears. At the bottom, select **Combine** > **Combine and Transform Data**.
4. In the Power Query Editor, confirm the region detection and preview the data. Click **OK**.

### Cleaning Data in Power Query

In the Power Query Editor:

- The left pane shows queries created to combine files.
- The center pane previews the combined data from all files.
- The ribbon offers tools to clean and transform data (e.g., removing rows, splitting columns, grouping).
- Example: Remove an unnecessary column (e.g., file name) by selecting it and pressing **Delete**.
- The **Applied Steps** pane records all actions, allowing reuse for future updates.

### Loading and Refreshing Data

To load the data:

1. Go to the **Home** tab, select **Close and Load** > **Close and Load To**.
2. Choose to load to a **PivotTable Report** to keep file size small (avoiding a table in the worksheet).
3. Click **OK**, and the PivotTable field list appears with fields (e.g., **Date**, **Region**, **Revenue**).
4. Summarize data as needed (e.g., by **Date** and **Region** with **Revenue** as the value).

To update with new data:

1. Add the new file (e.g., July's data) to the folder.
2. In Excel, right-click the PivotTable and select **Refresh**.
3. For multiple reports, use **Data** > **Refresh All** to update all connected queries.

This provides scalable, automatic data cleaning and gathering.

## 2020s: Dynamic Arrays

Dynamic Arrays, introduced recently, revolutionized formula results by allowing multiple results to spill and resize automatically as data changes, eliminating the need for helper columns or **Ctrl+Shift+Enter**.

### Building a Dynamic Summary

To create a summary by year and category:

1. Use the **UNIQUE** function to list years: `=SORT(UNIQUE(Table1[Year]))`. The **SORT** function ensures years are sorted.
2. For categories across columns, use: `=TRANSPOSE(SORT(UNIQUE(Table1[Category])))`.
3. Use **SUMIFS** to aggregate sales:
    - Formula: `=SUMIFS(Table1[Sales], Table1[Year], A2#, Table1[Category], B1#)`.
    - `A2#` and `B1#` reference the spilled arrays for years and categories, ensuring automatic updates when new data is added.

This creates a dynamic summary that expands with new data.

### Alternative: PIVOTBY Function

The **PIVOTBY** function builds a PivotTable-like summary with a single formula:

- Formula: `=PIVOTBY(Table1[Year], Table1[Category], Table1[Sales], SUM)`.
- This groups data by **Year** (rows) and **Category** (columns), sums **Sales**, and automatically sorts labels with totals.

### Hidden Tip: Automatic Adaptation

Dynamic Arrays adapt as data changes:

1. Freeze panes (**View** > **Freeze Panes**) to keep the summary visible.
2. Add new data below the table (e.g., for 2026).
3. The table and summary (using **SUMIFS** or **PIVOTBY**) expand automatically to include the new data.

This ensures dynamic, maintenance-free reports.

## Combining Features for Powerful Reports

Each feature—PivotTables, Excel Tables, Power Query, and Dynamic Arrays—is powerful alone, but their true potential shines when combined to create dynamic reports and tools.
