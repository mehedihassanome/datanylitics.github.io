# Dashboard Creation and Discussion

![[Pasted image 20251014161602.png]]

## Sales Dashboard
- Evaluation of Sales Team

### Layout
- Creating 4 Section to feature 
- Most important Information

### Design and Layout

The dashboard design process involves several steps:

- Selecting colors and applying them to different sections
- Creating colored shapes and borders
- Grouping elements together for organization
- Aligning objects vertically, horizontally, and to the center of fields

### Key Metrics and Calculations

The dashboard includes calculations for:

- Total number of calls
- Month-wise sales
- Region-wise sales
- Deal closed values
- Service level metrics

### Implementation Steps

1. **Data Source Preparation**: Raw data is organized before being inserted into the dashboard
2. **Pivot Tables**: Creating pivot tables for calculations (4-5 calculations minimum)
3. **Visualization Elements**: Including bar charts, maps, and text boxes
4. **Color Coding and Formatting**: Applying conditional formatting with gradient fields

### Dashboard Components

#### Text Boxes and Labels

Text boxes are created for:

- Total calls
- Reached
- Target
- Money (deal value)

#### KPI
Use Power Pivot to generate key point indicator calculation
- Name
- Total Calls
- Calls Reached
- Deals Closed
- Deals Value ($)
- Sales By Month

Each element is positioned, sized, and formatted according to design specifications.

#### Maps and Visualizations

Maps are created for region-wise service levels. The system shows that 83% of location data was plotted with high confidence. Maps can be downloaded from Excel add-ins, including:

- BAM map
- Bing map
- Geographical heat map

#### Slicers and Interactivity

Slicers are created with specific naming conventions and color coding. When connected to the dashboard, they allow:

- Filtering by division
- Filtering by region
- Dynamic updates across all related visualizations

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Pivot Table Bugs

There are known bugs in Excel's pivot table functionality. One issue occurs when trying to get pivot reportsâ€”sometimes data won't update as expected. The solution involves:

1. Recreating the data in another sheet
2. Working from the new sheet
3. Returning to the original if needed

#### Data Integration Problems

When working with data, if issues persist, the data may need to be transferred to a different sheet and the work continued from there.

## Advanced Features and Tools

### Power BI vs Excel

Power BI offer more advanced data handling capabilities compared to basic Excel methods. The practice and methodology remain similar, but Power BI provides additional functionality for data transformation specially for large data visualization. and Excel on the other hand will use for mainly medium level data size.

### Python Integration in Excel

Python integration with Excel is available but presents challenges:

- It is a half-baked implementation
- There is no complete solution currently
- Environment setup is complex
- Data engineering considerations are necessary

The consensus is to be cautious about relying on Python in Excel for critical work, as the integration is still developing.

### AI and Data Analysis

When using AI tools for data analysis:

- AI can assist in generating prompts and directions
- AI can help identify patterns and suggest approaches
- However, AI should not be solely relied upon for decision-making
- Critical thinking and human judgment remain essential

**Important considerations**:

- Do not post all official data publicly
- Be careful with sensitive information
- AI provides opportunities but requires human oversight
- Proper prompting is essential for useful results

## Cybersecurity and Data Protection

### Emerging Threats

Neuro-marketing and biometric tracking present new security concerns:

- Mobile phones collect extensive data through biometric sensors (fingerprint, facial recognition)
- Connection to public networks increases vulnerability
- Phishing attempts targeting bank accounts and personal information

### Real-World Examples

Phone calls impersonating police or officials asking for verification links or personal information are common scams. These require careful verification before responding.

### General Security Practices

- Verify the source of requests
- Avoid sharing sensitive information
- Be aware of social engineering tactics
- Maintain skepticism toward unsolicited contact

## Career Development and Skill Enhancement

### Data Analytics as a Career

Data analytics is presented as a significant career path in Bangladesh and worldwide. The field involves:

- Learning from industry experts
- Building a strong foundation in data analysis
- Developing practical skills alongside theoretical knowledge

### Building a Professional Network

The importance of:

- Connecting with mentors and experienced professionals
- Participating in peer learning groups
- Maintaining relationships with colleagues
- Sharing knowledge and resources

### Continuous Learning

Professionals should:

- Regularly update their skills
- Explore new tools and techniques
- Engage with industry trends
- Practice implementation of learned concepts

## Interactive Discussion and Q&A

### Dashboard Customization

Questions about dashboard interactivity:

- When clicking on names (Alex, Bob, Charlie, Chris), specific filters activate
- When clicking on division, all related data is filtered accordingly
- Report connections are essential for proper functionality
- Slicer organization affects user experience

### Tool Selection and Best Practices

For large datasets: Use Excel, Power BI, or advanced tools depending on data volume and requirements.

For medium-sized data: Excel is typically sufficient.

Data sources can be sourced from platforms like Kaggle.

### AI Tool Recommendations

Tools like ChatGPT for Excel are available but require:

- Adequate screen space
- Careful prompt engineering
- Verification of results

## Additional Resources and Support

### Contact and Collaboration

Participants are encouraged to:

- Connect through WhatsApp groups for ongoing communication
- Share resources and discuss challenges
- Request help with specific problems
- Collaborate on projects

### Geographic Connections

The group includes participants from various locations:

- Bogura
- Rangpur
- Dhaka
- Other regions across Bangladesh

### Ongoing Support

The instructor commits to:

- Providing additional help through group chats
- Supporting project work and skill development
- Offering guidance for career advancement
- Maintaining connections with participants

## Closing Remarks

The session concludes with appreciation for participant engagement and questions. The instructor emphasizes:

- The value of interaction over robotic instruction
- The importance of a supportive learning community
- Commitment to providing quality training
- Recognition that learning is a mutual process

The group established a WhatsApp chat for continued connection and collaboration among participants.
