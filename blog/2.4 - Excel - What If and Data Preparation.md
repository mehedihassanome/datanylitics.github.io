# Using Goal Seek for What-If Analysis

## Introduction

In financial and business analysis, calculating key metrics such as margin is essential. Margin can be derived from a formula involving revenue, cost, and quantity. However, determining the exact input values to achieve a specific margin can be challenging. This document explains how to use the Goal Seek tool to perform what-if analysis, allowing you to find precise input values to meet desired outcomes.

## Margin Calculation

To calculate margin, we use the formula: $$ \text{Margin} = (\text{Rate} - \text{Cost}) \times \text{Quantity} $$

For example, with a given rate, cost, and quantity, the margin might be approximately $7000$. But what if you want to achieve a specific margin, such as $10000$ or $15000$? Manually iterating through different values for rate or quantity can be time-consuming and imprecise.

## What-If Analysis with Goal Seek

Goal Seek is a powerful tool that automates the process of finding the exact input value needed to achieve a target output. It eliminates the need for manual iteration by adjusting a specified variable to meet the desired goal.

### Example 1: Achieving a $15000$ Margin by Adjusting Quantity

Suppose you want to achieve a margin of $15000$ by changing the quantity while keeping the rate and cost constant. Using Goal Seek:

1. Set the target cell (margin) to $15000$. `($J$6) = 10080`
2. Specify the quantity as the variable to change. `$G$6 = 180`
3. Run Goal Seek to calculate the required quantity.

For instance, if the initial quantity is 135 and the margin is $7000$, Goal Seek might determine that a quantity of approximately $267.8$ (rounded to 268) will yield a margin of $15000$. This precise value ensures the desired outcome without trial and error.

### Example 2: Achieving a $15000$ Margin by Adjusting Rate

Alternatively, you may want to achieve a $15000$ margin by adjusting the rate while keeping the quantity and cost constant. For example:

- Initial rate: $123$
- Initial quantity: 135
- Current margin: $7000$

Using Goal Seek:

1. Set the target cell (margin) to $15000$.
2. Specify the rate as the variable to change.
3. Run Goal Seek to find the new rate.

Goal Seek might calculate that a rate of $178$ will achieve the $15000$ margin, even with the same quantity of goods.

## Benefits of Goal Seek

Goal Seek is a versatile tool for analyzing what-if scenarios. It allows you to:

- Quickly determine the exact input values needed to meet financial targets.
- Avoid manual iteration, saving time and reducing errors.
- Analyze multiple variables, such as rate or quantity, to understand their impact on outcomes.

## Conclusion

Goal Seek simplifies complex what-if analyses by providing precise solutions for achieving target metrics like margin. By adjusting variables such as quantity or rate, you can efficiently explore different scenarios and make informed decisions. This tool is invaluable for financial modeling and business planning.

# Data Sorting Techniques

## Introduction

Sorting is a fundamental tool for organizing data efficiently. This document explains how to perform single-column and multi-criteria sorting in a spreadsheet, as well as basic formatting and data management techniques to enhance data analysis.

## Single-Column Sorting

Sorting data in a spreadsheet can be done without selecting the entire dataset. Instead, you can select any cell within the column you wish to sort and apply the desired sorting order.

### Sorting by Product

To sort data by product name, select a cell in the product column and choose either:

- **A to Z**: Ascending order (e.g., alphabetical order for product names).
- **Z to A**: Descending order.

For example, sorting products A to Z will arrange items like "Box" before "BORISEL."

### Sorting by Date

To sort by date, select a cell in the date column and apply:

- **A to Z**: Earliest to latest date.
- **Z to A**: Latest to earliest date.

For instance, sorting Z to A will place the most recent date, such as February 11th, at the top.

## Multi-Criteria Sorting

When sorting by multiple criteria, you can define a sequence of sorting rules to organize data hierarchically. This is useful when you need to sort data by multiple columns, such as product, region, customer, and margin.

### Example: Sorting by Multiple Criteria

To sort data with the following priorities:

1. **Product** (A to Z): Arrange products alphabetically.
2. **Region** (A to Z): Within each product, sort by region.
3. **Customer** (A to Z): Within each region, sort by customer name.
4. **Margin** (Largest to Smallest): Within each customer, sort by margin value.

This results in a structured dataset where, for example:

- All "Box" products appear before "BORISEL."
- Within "Box," regions are sorted alphabetically (e.g., Health Corporation, Nasha Duniya Corporation).
- Within each region, customers are sorted alphabetically.
- Within each customer, margins are sorted from largest to smallest (e.g., $70$, $60$, $50$).

### Notes on Margin

Some products, like "Box," may show no margin due to their use in promotional projects, while others, like "Color Pencil," reflect varying margins based on region or customer.

## Formatting and Data Management

### Highlighting Data

To emphasize specific data, you can apply formatting. For example:

- Select a cell or range and use the **F4** shortcut to apply a color, such as red, to highlight important information.

### Reviewing Sorted Data

After sorting and formatting, the dataset can provide clear insights. For example:
![[Pasted image 20251018151621.png]]

- **Customer-wise sorting** may reveal patterns in revenue or margin.
- **Region-wise sorting** can highlight regional performance differences.

## Example Dataset

The following dataset illustrates the concepts of single-column and multi-criteria sorting. It includes products, regions, customers, dates, and margins, as referenced in the sorting examples.

|Product|Region|Customer|Date|Margin|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Box|North|Health Corporation|2025-02-01|0|
|Box|North|Nasha Duniya Corporation|2025-02-05|0|
|Box|South|Health Corporation|2025-02-03|0|
|BORISEL|East|Acme Retail|2025-02-07|50|
|BORISEL|West|Global Traders|2025-02-09|60|
|Color Pencil|East|Acme Retail|2025-02-11|70|
|Color Pencil|South|Nasha Duniya Corporation|2025-02-04|50|
|Color Pencil|West|Global Traders|2025-02-06|60|

### Usage Notes

- **Single-Column Sorting**: Sorting the dataset by **Product** (A to Z) will group all "Box" entries first, followed by "BORISEL," then "Color Pencil." Sorting by **Date** (Z to A) will place February 11, 2025, at the top.
- **Multi-Criteria Sorting**: Sorting by **Product** (A to Z), then **Region** (A to Z), **Customer** (A to Z), and **Margin** (Largest to Smallest) will organize the data hierarchically, as described in the _Multi-Criteria Sorting_ section.
- **Formatting Example**: Highlight the "Color Pencil" rows in red using the **F4** shortcut to emphasize high-margin products.
- **Deletion Example**: Remove the "Box" product rows if they are promotional and no longer needed.

## Conclusion

Sorting, whether single-column or multi-criteria, is a powerful way to organize and analyze data. By combining sorting with formatting and data management techniques, you can create a clear and actionable view of your dataset. Experiment with different sorting orders and formatting options to uncover meaningful insights.
